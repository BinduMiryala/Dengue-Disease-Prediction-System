# 🚨 Dengue Disease Prediction System 🚨

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Dengue Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-powered solution designed to predict dengue outbreaks based on weather data. By analyzing key environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and rainfall, the system helps predict the likelihood of a dengue outbreak in specific regions. This predictive model can be used by health authorities to implement timely interventions, ultimately reducing the risk of a large-scale epidemic.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**:
  - **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
  - **NumPy**: Numerical operations
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
  - **Flask**: Web deployment for real-time predictions (optional)
  - **Joblib**: Model serialization
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: For classification based on weather data
  - **Logistic Regression**: Simple and efficient classification algorithm
  - **SVM**: Support Vector Machine for classification tasks
- **Development Environment**: VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook
- **Database (if applicable)**: SQLite/MySQL (for storing historical data)

## 🚀 Features & Highlights

- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes historical weather data to predict the likelihood of a dengue outbreak.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easily integrate with a web-based application for real-time predictions (via Flask).
- **Data Insights**: Gain insights into the key factors influencing dengue outbreaks through data visualizations.
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled to predict outbreaks for various regions and weather patterns.
